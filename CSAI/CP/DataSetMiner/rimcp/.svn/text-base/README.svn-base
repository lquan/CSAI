This is RIMCP.

RIMCP is based on CP4IM:

It is part of an exercise for "Capita Selecta Artificial Intelligence":

Compiling:
==========
Run the following commands on a Unix command line:

./autogen.sh
make

This should automatically download and compile Gecode with the correct flags, 
as well as compile RIMCP against this Gecode code base.
Please note that compiling Gecode for the first time can take a long time.

./autogen.sh requires autoconf and automake to be installed.
In Ubuntu systems, these can be installed with

sudo apt-get install autoconf automake 

Troubleshooting:
================
Compilation errors on some systems can be due to
incorrectly linked/compiled libraries - make sure that src/Makefile.am
includes the correct libraries in the LDADD variable.


Running:
========
To run the code, download an arff file from the course website.
Run it with:

./rimcp -datafile filename.arff

in the src directory.
Please note that the current code is incomplete and hence will not compute 
something useful.

At least the file "my_regression.cpp" needs to be modified - instructions
on how to do this can be found in this "my_regression.cpp".


Troubleshooting:
================
Your system needs to be able to find the Gecode libraries. Ensure that the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable includes the correct directory, eg. type on the
command line before running ./rimcp:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=lib/gecode-3.4.2
